# Running your Mocha test
To run your Mocha test, you need to use Mocha's command-line utility that you previously installed. To do so, use your command-line tool and navigate to your project's base folder. Then, issue the following command:

```$ NODE_ENV=test mocha --reporter spec app/tests```
Windows users should first execute the following command:

```set NODE_ENV=test```
Then run Mocha using the following command:

```mocha --reporter spec app/tests```
